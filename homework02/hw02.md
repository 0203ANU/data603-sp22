- Lack of security features


### Let's have a look at how Data Lakes differentiates from Data lakehouses and Data warehouses

| Data Lake | Data Lakehouse | Data Warehouse |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Low cost   |     Low cost   |  Low cost |
| Open format | Open format | Closed Proprietary format |
| All type - data struture | All type - data structure| Only structured data

### Sql: 
> It is a relational database management system(RDBMS) model. Data is organized into tables. It typically employees Structured Query Language for managing and accessing data hel within database.


### NoSql:
> It refers to any DBMS that does not employ the relational model. Nosql databases are equipped to handle normalized data and they are able to sort data within a predefined schema, their respective data models usually allows for far freater flexibility then the rigid structure imposed by relational databases. 
> There are several data models associated with NoSql concepts:
> - Key Value store
> - Columnar database
> - Document store
> - Grpah database
