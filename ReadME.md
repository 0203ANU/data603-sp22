### Initial<br>
Initially, my research paper topic was " Analysis of Cloud Computing Algorithms". For this I was trying to cover the distributed computing frameworks. I was thinking to discuss various benefits and major security challegenges of cloud computing, highlighting crytographic encryption algorithms as the major solution of security challegenes. <br>
### Outline
After submitting the initial proposal, professor Andrew gave his peiece of advice that the idea was too board for a 4-5 minute research paper. After his suggestion, I thought to model the paper purely based on the comparison of Hadoop and Spark. 
<br>
### Final
For the final paper, I have tried to model the topic to  compare the framework of Hadoop and Apache.  
In this research paper, I have given a brief introduction about how evolution of big data has influenced distrbuted computing. New programming platform like Hadoop and Spark has been a big game changer. Hadoop framework is based on MapReduce distributed file system where as Spark is a recently developed big data management framework.
